OpenFace is a Python and [Torch](http://torch.ch) implementation of the CVPR
2015 paper
[FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/app/1A_089.pdf)
by Florian Schroff, Dmitry Kalenichenko, and James Philbin at Google
using publicly available libraries and datasets.
Torch allows the network to be executed on a CPU or with CUDA.

### Isn't face recognition a solved problem?
No! Accuracies from research papers have just begun to surpass
human accuracies on some benchmarks.
The accuracies of open source face recognition systems lag
behind the state-of-the-art.
See our accuracy comparisons on the famous LFW benchmark below.

# Overview

The following overview shows the workflow for a single input
image of Sylvestor Stallone from the publicly available
[LFW dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/person/Sylvester_Stallone.html).

1. Detect faces with a pre-trained models from
  [dlib](http://blog.dlib.net/2014/02/dlib-186-released-make-your-own-object.html)
  or
  [OpenCV](http://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_face_detection.html).
2. Transform the face for the neural network.
   This repository uses dlib's
   [real-time pose estimation](http://blog.dlib.net/2014/08/real-time-face-pose-estimation.html)
   with OpenCV's
   [affine transformation](http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/imgproc/imgtrans/warp_affine/warp_affine.html)
   to try to make the eyes and nose appear in
   the same location on each image.
3. Use a deep neural network to represent (or embed) the face on
   a 128-dimensional unit hypersphere.
   The embedding is a generic representation for anybody's face.
   Unlike other face representations, this embedding has the nice property
   that a larger distance between two face embeddings means
   that the faces are likely not of the same person.
   This property makes clustering, similarity detection,
   and classification tasks easier than other face recognition
   techniques where the Euclidean distance between
   features is not meaningful.
4. Apply your favorite clustering or classification techniques
   to the features to complete your recognition task.
   See below for our examples for classification and
   similarity detection, including an online web demo.
